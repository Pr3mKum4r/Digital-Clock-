# Digital-Clock-
I made a digital clock using JS, CSS and HTML
The aim of the project is to design a twelve hour Digital Clock that displays the time digitally, in contrast to an analog clock, where the time is indicated by the positions of rotating hands. With the help of counters and decoders, a digital clock to display time in hours, minutes and seconds can be constructed.
 Digital clock in which the hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds are indicated by digits, rather than by hands on a dial.
“Time doesn't heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go.”
